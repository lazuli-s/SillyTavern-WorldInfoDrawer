 ## Main changes from Lenny's original version
 
 - New “fill empty titles” toggle to auto-label entries that don’t have a title.
 - Expanded sorting: choose from title, position, depth, order, UID, trigger/keyword, or token count, with ascending/descending controls.
 - Order Helper is now per-book as well as global, so each lorebook can keep its own manual ordering while still offering a global fallback toggle.
 - Added a refresh button alongside the drawer controls for quick syncs after edits.
 - You can sort each book individually or switch to global sorting via the per-book sort toggle and “clear preferences” control.
 - The Order Helper now lets you pick which entries to update and optionally hide keywords for a cleaner view while reordering.
 
 ## Installation
 
 1. Paste this link into SillyTavern extensions panel:
    ```
    https://github.com/lazuli-s/SillyTavern-WorldInfoDrawer.git
    ```
 2. Restart SillyTavern.
 
+## Vanilla SillyTavern reference (dev-only)
+
+This repo includes a **read-only** vanilla SillyTavern reference under `vendor/sillytavern/` so developers/Codex can verify imports and internals. This is pinned to the stable release tag **`1.14.0`** and is **not** used at runtime.
+
+> Users do **not** need submodules to install or run this extension.
+
 ## Usage tips
 
 - Open the WorldInfo Drawer from the top menu bar.
 - Use the Order Helper to drag items, select the entries to update, and apply the new order in one action.
 - Toggle "fill empty titles" before saving to auto-name unlabeled entries.
 - Use per-book sort preferences when you want manual control per lorebook, or clear preferences to return to global sorting.
 
 ## To-do list
 - Make the filter system easier to use.
 - Fix some CSS alignment issues.

 ## Contributing
 
 A warning: I have no idea what I'm doing with my life, and this was completely vibe coded using Codex. But it seems to work! I've been testing it for a while, and no console errors so far.
 
 So if you find a bug or a potential issue, please tell me and I'll do my best to ask GPT 5.2 to fix it (or please do the git thing if you actually know something about coding and want to fix the issue yourself).
 
 Please tell me if you have any ideas or suggestions as well. I think World Info is probably the best ST feature so far, and I've probably spent a very shameful amount of hours editing lore on this extension drawer. I'm very glad Lenny made this, and I hope more users become aware of this great extension.

+# Vanilla SillyTavern reference (read-only)
+
+## Purpose
+This repo keeps a **read-only** copy of vanilla SillyTavern so Codex (and developers) can verify SillyTavern internals (imports/exports, file locations, and API surfaces) without guessing. It is **not** used at runtime and **must never** become a dependency for the extension.
+
+## Pinned upstream release
+- Repo: https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern
+- Release tag: `1.14.0`
+- Commit SHA: `9c9be90821ffd6132b40b5f04982522a61d7ad30`
+- Submodule path: `vendor/sillytavern/`
+
+## Read-only guardrails
+- **Do not edit anything under `vendor/sillytavern/`.**
+- **Do not import from `vendor/sillytavern/` at runtime.** This is for development/AI reference only.
+- **Do not ship or require this submodule for users.** It is optional and purely informational.
+
+## Updating to the next stable release
+1. Find the latest stable release tag (not a preview/beta):
+   ```bash
+   git ls-remote --tags https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern.git
+   ```
+2. Update the submodule and checkout the tag:
+   ```bash
+   git -C vendor/sillytavern fetch --tags
+   git -C vendor/sillytavern checkout tags/<NEW_TAG>
+   ```
+3. Record the new tag + commit SHA in this file:
+   ```bash
+   git -C vendor/sillytavern rev-parse HEAD
+   ```
+4. Commit the submodule pointer update in the parent repo.
