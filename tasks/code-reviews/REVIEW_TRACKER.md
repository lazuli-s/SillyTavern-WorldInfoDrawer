### `src/drawer.js`
â†’ `CodeReview_drawer.js.md`

- **F01** â€” New-book creation awaits non-specific "update started" promise â€” race with cache init
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Implementation plan needs revision ðŸŸ¡
    - Reason: Checklist needs to explicitly register `waitForWorldInfoUpdate()` *before* `createNewWorldInfo(...)` and remove redundant investigation step.
  - Implemented: âœ…
    - Implementation Notes: Registered `waitForWorldInfoUpdate()` before `createNewWorldInfo(...)` and added cache/DOM guard with refresh fallback before scrolling to the new book.
    - **ðŸŸ¥ MANUAL CHECK**: [ ] Create a new book while other updates are happening; confirm the new book expands and scrolls into view without console errors.

- **F02** â€” Drawer "reopen" MutationObserver forces synthetic click that can discard unsaved edits
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Implementation plan needs revision ðŸŸ¡
    - Reason: Fix plan is ambiguous (prompt vs skip); must pick a single least-behavior-change rule and declare consistency/dependency with other dirty-guard fixes.
  - Implemented: âœ…
    - Implementation Notes: Drawer reopen observer now skips the synthetic entry-row click when the current editor is dirty, preventing unsaved input loss.
    - **ðŸŸ¥ MANUAL CHECK**: [ ] Open an entry, type without saving, close and reopen the drawer; confirm typed text is preserved and no unexpected blank editor state occurs.

- **F03** â€” Delete handler reads live `selectionState` across `await` â€” can delete wrong entries
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Implementation plan needs revision ðŸŸ¡
    - Reason: Remove optional behavior-changing "abort if selection changes" branch; snapshot-only should be the sole recommendation.
  - Implemented: âœ…
    - Implementation Notes: Delete hotkey now snapshots `selectFrom` and selected UIDs before any `await` to prevent selection changes from affecting an in-flight delete.
    - **ðŸŸ¥ MANUAL CHECK**: [ ] Select multiple entries, press Delete, then quickly click another book; confirm only the originally selected entries are deleted.

- **F04** â€” Drawer-open detection uses `elementFromPoint` at screen center â€” brittle with overlays
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Implementation plan discarded ðŸ”´
    - Reason: Impact claim is not evidence-backed (likely false negatives vs false positives) and proposed fix is ambiguous/multi-option; requires broader runtime validation.
  - Implemented: âŒ Skipped (ðŸ”´ discarded)
    - Implementation Notes: Skipped â€” plan discarded; requires runtime validation to choose an authoritative drawer-open signal and overlay behavior.

- **F05** â€” No teardown for `moSel`/`moDrawer` MutationObservers â€” accumulate on reload
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Implementation plan discarded ðŸ”´
    - Reason: Relies on unproven in-place reload lifecycle and lacks a concrete teardown trigger; needs a verified lifecycle hook or a broader singleton/teardown strategy.
  - Implemented: âŒ Skipped (ðŸ”´ discarded)
    - Implementation Notes: Skipped â€” plan discarded; no evidence-backed teardown lifecycle beyond `beforeunload` to safely disconnect observers on reload.

- **F06** â€” Splitter drag lifecycle missing `pointercancel` â€” listeners can leak
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Ready to implement ðŸŸ¢
    - Reason: N/A
  - Implemented: âœ…
    - Implementation Notes: Added `pointercancel` and `lostpointercapture` termination paths to splitter drag cleanup so listeners always detach and width persists.
    - **ðŸŸ¥ MANUAL CHECK**: [ ] Start dragging the splitter, then alt-tab / open an OS overlay / trigger a gesture cancel; confirm the list is still resizable afterward and the final width persists after reload.

- **F07** â€” Toggling Activation Settings / Order Helper clears entry editor without dirty-state guard
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Implementation plan needs revision ðŸŸ¡
    - Reason: Fix plan is ambiguous (prompt vs refuse); should pick a single least-scope behavior (skip toggle when dirty) and keep dirty-guard behavior consistent with F02.
  - Implemented: âœ…
    - Implementation Notes: Added dirty guards to Activation Settings and Order Helper toggles, showing a toast and blocking mode switches that would discard unsaved edits.
    - **ðŸŸ¥ MANUAL CHECK**: [ ] Type unsaved edits in an entry, click the gear/order toggle; confirm a toast appears and the editor content remains unchanged.

- **F08** â€” `addDrawer()` has no singleton guard â€” multiple inits duplicate UI and global listeners
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Implementation plan discarded ðŸ”´
    - Reason: Requires evidence of in-place reload + a concrete singleton registry/teardown strategy; "skip init" risks breaking `initDrawer()` consumers and fix risk is under-rated.
  - Implemented: âŒ Skipped (ðŸ”´ discarded)
    - Implementation Notes: Skipped â€” plan discarded; safe idempotent init/teardown requires validated ST reload semantics and a concrete singleton/registry approach.

-> `CodeReview_editorPanel.js.md`

- **F01** â€” Dirty tracking silently fails for entry UID `0` because of falsy checks
  - Meta-reviewed: [ ]
    - Verdict: 
    - Reason: 
  - Implemented:

### `src/listPanel.bookMenu.js`
-> `CodeReview_listPanel.bookMenu.js.md`

- **F01** -- Duplicate-book detection can pick the wrong new book under concurrent creates
  - Meta-reviewed: [ ]
    - Verdict:
    - Reason:
  - Implemented:

- **F02** -- Move-to-folder actions can discard unsaved editor edits via forced list refresh
  - Meta-reviewed: [ ]
    - Verdict:
    - Reason:
  - Implemented:

- **F03** -- Folder import can abort mid-run and leave partial/empty books without clear recovery
  - Meta-reviewed: [ ]
    - Verdict:
    - Reason:
  - Implemented:

- **F04** -- Exported book payload drops metadata needed for folder/sort restoration
  - Meta-reviewed: [ ]

### `src/bookSourceLinks.js`
â†’ `CodeReview_bookSourceLinks.js.md`

- **F01** â€” `cleanup()` does not unsubscribe `eventSource` listeners (leak / duplicate refresh on re-init)
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Ready to implement ðŸŸ¢
    - Reason: N/A
  - Implemented: ✅
    - Implementation Notes: Added tracked event subscriptions and cleanup-time `eventSource.removeListener(...)` teardown for all source-link event handlers.
    - **🟥 MANUAL CHECK**:
      - [ ] Reopen/reinitialize the drawer extension, then switch chats/characters and confirm source-link refresh events fire once per action.

- **F02** â€” `getBookSourceLinks()` fallback returns a different object shape than normal entries
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Implementation plan needs revision ðŸŸ¡
    - Reason: Impact/severity rationale is overstated; at least one current caller normalizes missing fields, so validate other call sites and adjust severity/justification accordingly.
  - Implemented: ✅
    - Implementation Notes: Expanded the fallback object to full link shape and verified existing callers still normalize safely.
    - **🟥 MANUAL CHECK**:
      - [ ] Open the book list with mixed source-linked and unlinked books and confirm source icons/tooltips render without missing text or errors.

- **F03** â€” Signature computation uses full `JSON.stringify(nextLinks)` (unnecessary churn + ordering sensitivity)
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Implementation plan needs revision ðŸŸ¡
    - Reason: Performance/ordering instability claims are plausible but unproven; revise toward a minimal, lower-risk stabilization (e.g., canonicalize `characterNames` ordering) and avoid over-scoped signature refactor.
  - Implemented: ✅
    - Implementation Notes: Added canonical source-link signature generation with sorted keys/names and kept refresh early-return behavior unchanged.
    - **🟥 MANUAL CHECK**:
      - [ ] Trigger source-link refresh events (chat switch, character edit, settings update) and confirm icons/tooltips refresh when actual links change.

- **F04** â€” Direct imports from internal ST modules increase upstream breakage risk (prefer `getContext()` where possible)
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Implementation plan needs revision ðŸŸ¡
    - Reason: Must include an explicit compatibility policy (minimum supported ST version) or a context-first fallback strategy; otherwise refactor can introduce host-version breakages.
  - Implemented: ✅
    - Implementation Notes: Refactored to context-first runtime access with direct-import fallback strategy for compatibility across host versions.
    - **🟥 MANUAL CHECK**:
      - [ ] Switch chats/groups/characters and verify source-link icons still update correctly with no console errors on your current SillyTavern version.

### `src/constants.js`
â†’ `CodeReview_constants.js.md`

- **F01** â€” `SORT_DIRECTION` docstrings are incorrect/misaligned with actual meaning
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Ready to implement ðŸŸ¢
    - Reason: N/A
  - **Neglect Risk:** Low â­• â€” Documentation-only mismatch; leaving it unfixed mainly risks developer confusion.
  - Implemented:

- **F02** â€” Recursion option values are duplicated across modules â€” drift risk breaks filters/indicators
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Ready to implement ðŸŸ¢
    - Reason: N/A
  - **Neglect Risk:** Medium â— â€” Duplication increases future drift risk that can break filter behavior/indicators in Order Helper.
  - Implemented:

- **F03** â€” Column-schema â€œsyncâ€ is comment-only â€” mismatch can silently break column visibility/persistence
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Implementation plan needs revision ðŸŸ¡
    - Reason: Step 1 plan is ambiguous about fallback policy and does not specify canonical schema key handling in state/hydration.
  - **Neglect Risk:** Medium â— â€” Drift would silently degrade column visibility persistence, making preferences feel unreliable.
  - Implemented:

- **F04** â€” Exported â€œconstantâ€ objects/arrays are mutable â€” accidental mutation can cascade across UI
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Implementation plan discarded ðŸ”´
    - Reason: Requires extensive analysis to validate absence of runtime mutation paths; freezing could introduce runtime exceptions.
  - **Neglect Risk:** Low â­• â€” No evidence of current mutation; risk is mostly hypothetical unless future code mutates shared schema.
  - Implemented:

- **F05** â€” `SORT` enum names overlap conceptually (TITLE vs ALPHABETICAL) â€” increases future misuse risk
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Implementation plan needs revision ðŸŸ¡
    - Reason: Step 1 fix references UI label mapping without evidence the option is exposed, and misses the concrete doc mismatch vs `sortEntries()` behavior.
  - **Neglect Risk:** Low â­• â€” Primarily a maintainability/docs clarity issue; limited immediate user impact.
  - Implemented:

### `src/orderHelperRender.actionBar.js`
â†’ `CodeReview_orderHelperRender.actionBar.js.md`

- **F01** â€” Bulk-apply actions can throw if table DOM/cache is not ready (missing null guards)
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Ready to implement ðŸŸ¢
    - Reason: N/A
  - **Neglect Risk:** Medium â— â€” Crash during bulk operations can disrupt user workflow and require drawer reopen.
  - Implemented: ✅
    - Implementation Notes: Added safe tbody/entry guards for bulk apply handlers so invalid table/cache rows are skipped instead of throwing.
    - **🟥 MANUAL CHECK**:
      - [ ] Open Order Helper, trigger a quick refresh, click bulk Apply buttons, and confirm there are no console errors and valid selected rows still update.

- **F02** â€” Outside-click listeners can leak if the component is removed while menus are open
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Implementation plan needs revision ðŸŸ¡
    - Reason: Needs research step to validate existing cleanup coverage via MULTISELECT_DROPDOWN_CLOSE_HANDLER and exact lifecycle before implementation.
  - **Neglect Risk:** Low â­• â€” Listener leak only affects repeated opens without page reload; speculative severity.
  - Implemented: ✅
    - Implementation Notes: Added bulk-row cleanup plus renderer rerender cleanup invocation to always remove outlet outside-click listeners.
    - **🟥 MANUAL CHECK**:
      - [ ] Open the outlet dropdown, switch Order Helper scope or rerender, and confirm no ghost outside-click behavior remains.

- **F03** â€” Bulk apply loops can freeze the UI on large tables (no yielding in hot loops)
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Implementation plan needs revision ðŸŸ¡
    - Reason: Async yielding introduces behavioral changes (user interaction during gaps) that require button-disabling mitigation.
  - **Neglect Risk:** Low â­• â€” Performance-only issue; only affects users with large lorebooks and no data loss risk.
  - Implemented: ✅
    - Implementation Notes: Refactored State/Strategy/Order bulk applies to precompute targets, lock Apply buttons, and yield every 200 rows.
    - **🟥 MANUAL CHECK**:
      - [ ] Run State/Strategy/Order apply on a large entry list and confirm the button is temporarily disabled, the UI stays responsive, and final saved values are correct.

- **F04** â€” Direction radios are not grouped as radios (no `name`), risking inconsistent UI/accessibility
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Ready to implement ðŸŸ¢
    - Reason: N/A
  - **Neglect Risk:** Low â­• â€” Accessibility/maintenance concern only; mouse behavior works correctly.
  - Implemented: ✅
    - Implementation Notes: Grouped direction radios with a shared name and switched persistence to change handlers with native exclusivity.
    - **🟥 MANUAL CHECK**:
      - [ ] Toggle Direction between up/down and reload; confirm the selected option persists and only one option can be selected at a time.

  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Ready to implement ðŸŸ¢
    - Reason: N/A
  - **Neglect Risk:** Medium â— â€” Can cause hard crashes if tooltip receives non-string values.
  - Implemented:

- **F02** â€” `wireMultiselectDropdown()` does not keep `aria-expanded` in sync with open/close state
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Ready to implement ðŸŸ¢
    - Reason: N/A
  - **Neglect Risk:** Low â­• â€” Accessibility issue only; no functional impact.
  - Implemented:

- **F03** â€” Outside-click `document` listener can leak if a menu is removed while open (no teardown path)
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Implementation plan discarded ðŸ”´
    - Reason: Finding contains a ðŸš© flag requiring user input. Per meta-review rules, findings with ðŸš© flags must be discarded.
  - **Neglect Risk:** Medium â— â€” Listener leaks can accumulate over repeated Order Helper opens/rerenders, causing performance degradation.

  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Ready to implement ðŸŸ¢
    - Reason: N/A
  - **Neglect Risk:** High â—â— â€” Real data integrity risk; users can lose edits when making rapid changes in Order Helper.
  - Implemented:

- **F02** â€” `updateCustomOrderFromDom()` can throw on missing book/entry during refresh/desync
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Ready to implement ðŸŸ¢

- **F03** â€” In-flight async filter execution can apply stale results after filter panel is no longer active
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Ready to implement ðŸŸ¢
    - Reason: N/A
  - Implemented: 
  - **Neglect Risk:** Low â­• â€” Edge case timing issue; users may see confusing background changes but no data loss.

- **F04** â€” Syntax highlighting runs on every keystroke and may cause input lag for long scripts
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]

  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Ready to implement ðŸŸ¢
    - Reason: N/A
  - **Neglect Risk:** Low â­• â€” Performance optimization; impact depends on dataset size and is cosmetic when small.
  - Implemented:

    - Reason: N/A
  - **Neglect Risk:** Medium â— â€” Silent failures confuse users when slash command actions (like STLO integration) don't work.
  - Implemented:

- **F02** -- Direct internal import of `SlashCommandParser` is brittle across SillyTavern updates
  - Meta-reviewed: [X]
    - Verdict: Ready to implement ðŸŸ¢
    - Reason: N/A
